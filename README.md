|------|-------------|
| `ringbuf.c` | A circular (ring) buffer implementation for `uint8_t` data, demonstrating safe FIFO read/write with full/empty error handling — the standard data structure used for UART receive buffering in embedded firmware. |

---

## Build Instructions

### Requirements
- GCC (`gcc --version` to verify)
- Linux, macOS, or Windows (MinGW / WSL)

### Compile

```bash
gcc -Wall -std=c99 ringbuf.c -o ringbuf
```

### Run

```bash
./ringbuf
```

### Expected Output

```
[WRITE] 0x41 -> OK (count=1)
[WRITE] 0x42 -> OK (count=2)
[WRITE] 0x43 -> OK (count=3)
[WRITE] 0x44 -> OK (count=4)
[WRITE] 0x45 -> OK (count=5)
[WRITE] 0x46 -> OK (count=6)
[WRITE] 0x47 -> OK (count=7)
[WRITE] 0x48 -> OK (count=8) FULL
[WRITE] 0x99 -> FAIL (buffer full)
[READ] -> 0x41 (count=7)
[READ] -> 0x42 (count=6)
[READ] -> 0x43 (count=5)
[WRITE] 0x49 -> OK (count=6)
[WRITE] 0x4A -> OK (count=7)
[WRITE] 0x4B -> OK (count=8) FULL
[READ] -> 0x44 (count=7)
[READ] -> 0x45 (count=6)
[READ] -> 0x46 (count=5)
[READ] -> 0x47 (count=4)
[READ] -> 0x48 (count=3)
[READ] -> 0x49 (count=2)
[READ] -> 0x4A (count=1)
[READ] -> 0x4B (count=0)
[READ] (empty) -> FAIL (buffer empty)
```

## Notes

- Uses `uint8_t` from `<stdint.h>` for all fixed-width data — no plain `int` or `char`.
- Buffer size defined via `#define BUFFER_SIZE 8` — no magic numbers.
- Wrap-around uses bitwise `& (BUFFER_SIZE - 1)` instead of `%` for MCU performance (see comment in source).
